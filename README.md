# Mushroom Classifier EnsembleBoost

This project focuses on classifying poisonous mushrooms using an ensemble of RandomForest and XGBoost models. Through careful feature engineering and model optimization, the ensemble approach achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.98439 on Kaggle. By combining the strengths of both algorithms, the model's predictive performance was significantly enhanced.
